The DelPreteFinal file contains all relevant code for the project Sam Colucci and Matthew Lawson worked for their MA 321 Statistical Consulting class in the Spring of 2020.
This file first finds correlations of the 5 index values and the femur head adjusted using the adjusted index values. The remaining analysis is done with the unadjusted data. The next main part of the file runs multiple ANCOVA tests, one for each index value. The covariate used was the femur head adjusted value. Post hocs tests were conducted to further look at differences within each factor and any relevant interactions. The final main part of the code compute the coefficients of variation for each of the 5 pelvic measurements in all 6 populations. The coefficients were computed for both the female and male measurements in each population. An asymptotic test was used to test the equality of two coefficients of variation within a certain population.
